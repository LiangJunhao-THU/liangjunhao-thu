About Me
======
I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate at Tsinghua University and a visiting researcher at [KatherLab](https://jnkather.github.io/). 

My research mainly focuses on <ins>computational pathology</ins>, especially using deep learning methods to find new cancer biomarkers, acquire low-dimensional knowledge from high-dimensional pathological images, and develop clinically useful framework for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  

I also study <ins>computational optics</ins> and develop <ins>histopathological optical imaging systems</ins>, which combine medical prior information and special optical methods to achieve clinically usable intraoperative rapid diagnosis and prognosis.
